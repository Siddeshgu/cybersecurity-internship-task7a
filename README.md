Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
Overview
This repository contains documentation and findings for the "Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions" task, part of the Cyber Security Internship at Elevate Labs. The objective is to learn how to spot, analyze, and remove potentially harmful browser extensions to improve browser security.

Steps Performed
Opened the extensions/add-ons manager in the chosen browser (Chrome/Firefox).

Reviewed all installed extensions, checking their purpose, permissions, and user reviews.

Identified and flagged any unused or suspicious extensions, or those requesting excessive permissions.

Researched suspicious extensions and checked for known security issues or negative feedback.

Removed the extensions deemed unnecessary or risky.

Restarted the browser and checked for improved performance or warnings.

Documented all actions taken, extensions reviewed, and those removed.

Key Learnings
Unused or poorly rated extensions can pose serious privacy and security risks.

Extensions requesting access to sensitive data or broad permissions should always be reviewed carefully.

Regularly auditing browser extensions is a simple but effective practice for reducing potential attack surfaces.

Research and community feedback are valuable resources for identifying malicious or vulnerable extensions.

Evidence
Screenshots of the extensions manager and removed extensions are provided in the repository for verification and documentation.
